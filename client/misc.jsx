	 Ideas for further development posted here for later...
	 Help Sasha gather all the grains from each level before sunrise!
	 Learn basic math skills and the existence of different types of grains while having fun :)

	 create a div border box for rules.
	 add level for every win until level 10.
	 reduce number of refreshes for every level
	 add a new grain for every level, in grainsBox and showing which grain picking. ie. Currently Picking: Rice.
	 add div on bottom where kids can learn about the grains they're picking.
